Hi there! my name is Hossein.
I've been learning Computer Science since 2017 till now.
In detail, i alwayse love sets and anything about it when i was in high school. After i entered in university noticed that data was another part of my love :)
Data Base Concepts was my favorite course cause it was the one in wiche maintaines sets of data we call relations(Tables) and put them together in a right way.
I would be happy if i could help people who looking for one with this skills...
